# Description

This script takes a torrent file and a directory as input and tries to rename 
files in the directory to match the file names in the torrent. This is useful 
for when you want to seed files for an existing torrent but the files you have 
does not have the same names as is already in registered in the torrent. Instead 
of renaming manually you can use this script.

# Usage 
./torrentmv.pl <file.torrent> <directory>
